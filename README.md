# Project-1 (Object Detection with OpenCV)
   # About this project 
      - this project is a personal project that im working on:
        - achive the following
          - get a better understaning of how python and its liberies work
          - explore Computer vision 
          - improve writing of modualar code 
# Objectives of the program 
  - Using OpenCV to detect objects captured by a Phone camera.
  - Object tracking is done on the computer where the data is put together.
   ## Objects it can capture (so far)
   1. Faces
